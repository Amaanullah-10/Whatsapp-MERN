Basically this is a WhatsApp Clone wherein here the main idea was to utilize MongoDb in the backend to fetch the details for the message. So this app will showcase the details to the client in the frontend by using React JS which will fetch the details by utilising the axios library and with the help of express we will be creating a server in order to work with the backend and front end.


In order to have a clearer view have a look by cloning and running the code but make sure that you initialise your own data in mongodb and make sure you install it if you don't know how to do this there are plethora of videos in YouTube which can help you with this and try to put same data as me or you can change if any queries 

Any doubts
